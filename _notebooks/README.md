## About the project 
This final project is part of a larger research question surrounding the renewed concerns associated with nuclear arms proliferation, specifically targeting the issue of decaying nuclear deterrence and disarmament structure. At the present, the two countries that hold approximately 90% of all nuclear weapons, the U.S. and Russia, are seeing their relations deteriorate to the lowest point since the end of the Cold War.

This project seeks to track historical changes in nuclear arsenals of the U.S. and Russia, note how these changes correspond to various global and bilateral treaties, and assess the possible scope of the next U.S.-Russia treaty on nuclear nonproliferation.
